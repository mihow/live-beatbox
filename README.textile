Experimental drum machine which uses vocalization to select synthetic drum hits which best match beat-boxed sound.

Currently uses a combination of MFCC, SpectralCentroid and ZeroCrossing measurements to analyze and match the timbre of the sounds.

In super-alpha-beta state! It may or may not work on your setup.

h2. Requirements

* "SuperCollider":http://supercollider.sourceforge.net

* Some sort of external microphone and audio interface. I use an Edirol FA101 when building this. I haven't got it working well with the Mac's internal sound

* OSX - unless you want to make the GUI stuff cross-platform.

h2. Keyboard shortcuts

* @F1@
Record mode
* @F2@
Preview recorded sound
* @F3@
Jamming mode
* @Space@
Start/stop sequencer
* @Return@
Add hit to seq (while playing)
* @Backsp.@
Remove hit (while playing)
* @Up/Down@
Select channel
* @Left/Rt@
Crossfader control

h2. TODO

* Add analysis of amplitude envelope, only uses timbral analysis at the moment which while quite good it needs amp.env. comparison to be really intuitive
* Add ability to scan and add samples via GUI, from any location
* Improve doc
* Lots more...
